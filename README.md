# Gravity intake

This project is based on the gravity intake found on https://gravity.nl/intake/.
For this assignment i've built a simple react application.

## Running a development version

In the project directory, you can run:
### `npm start`
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## Running a production version

### `npm install -g serve`
### `serve -s build`

## Added functionalities

Part of the assignment was to develop a new functionality.
Already included was the requirement to sort by manufacturing date, this has been expanded to be able to sort this ascending as well as descending.
I have also added the option to sort by price.
